# sandboxed-policies

![Version: 0.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.0.1-informational?style=flat-square)

A Helm chart to build and push polcies to support sandboxed containers into the spoke cluster of a validated pattern.

This chart is intended for use with the [coco-pattern](https://github.com/validatedpatterns/coco-pattern) and other validated patterns.

It is part of three charts that are intended to be used together:

1. [trustee](https://github.com/validatedpatterns/trustee-chart) intended to deploy the Key Broker Service (KBS) and related infrastructure to the ub cluster.
2. [sandboxed-containers](https://github.com/validatedpatterns/sandboxed-containers-chart) intended to be deployed on an ACM spoke cluster where there is access to confidential hardware
3. [sandboxed-policies](https://github.com/validatedpatterns/sandboxed-policies-chart), this chart, intended to be deployed on an ACM hub cluster which pushes polices to the spoke cluster.

A small number of imperative jobs are also part of the coco pattern which are used to push the polices to the spoke cluster.
